# constructor-hangman

Implemented Hangman game using objects, constructors in NodeJS programming languse. 

## How it works? 

- You can run the game by typing this "node index.js" in the terminal.
- A random word will be generated in the wordBank.js file.
- The program will show a number of underscore based on the number of the letters of the word.
- You have 10 attempts to guess the word.
- You need to enter one letter each time.
- Each time you have a correct letter guess, it will be replaced with the underscore in the right position in the word.
- Each time you guessed the word, your wins will be increment by 1.
- Each time you can not guess the word, your losses will be increment by 1.
- At the end of each round, you will be asked if you want to play again or not.
- Then you will be given a summary of how many rounds did you play and your wins and losses.
